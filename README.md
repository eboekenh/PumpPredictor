# 💧 Pump It Up: Data Mining the Water Table
## End to End Machine Learning Project for Predictive Maintenance Based on Historical Pump Data

This project is based on the [DrivenData competition](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/7/pump-it-up-data-mining-the-water-table/), which focuses on predicting the operational status of water pumps in Tanzania.

The goal is to build a machine learning model that can classify whether a water pump is:

- **Functional**
- **Functional needs repair**
- **Non-functional**

Understanding and optimizing water resource infrastructure is critical for public health and development. This project demonstrates how data science can be applied to real-world social impact challenges.
